# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the existing glassmorphism landing page frontend with the Python FastAPI backend to create a fully functional code review application. The integration will connect the interactive frontend elements with the backend APIs for file upload, code analysis, authentication, and real-time results display.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload code files through the frontend interface, so that I can analyze my code using the backend API

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the file upload button THEN the system SHALL open a file picker dialog
2. WHEN a user selects a supported code file THEN the system SHALL upload it to the backend `/api/review/upload` endpoint
3. WHEN the upload is successful THEN the system SHALL display the file content in the code editor
4. IF the upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate the file type and size on both frontend and backend

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to trigger code analysis from the frontend, so that I can get automated feedback on my code quality

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Run Analysis" button THEN the system SHALL send the code to the backend analysis API
2. WHEN analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator and disable the run button
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display the results in the results panel
4. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message with details
5. IF no code is present THEN the system SHALL prevent analysis and show a validation message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see real-time analysis results, so that I can understand the issues found in my code

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis results are received THEN the system SHALL update the issues list with detailed findings
2. WHEN results include severity levels THEN the system SHALL display appropriate visual indicators (colors, icons)
3. WHEN results include line numbers THEN the system SHALL highlight corresponding lines in the code editor
4. WHEN multiple issues exist THEN the system SHALL group them by severity and type
5. WHEN results include metrics THEN the system SHALL update the dashboard charts and counters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to authenticate with the system, so that I can access personalized features and save my analysis history

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses protected features THEN the system SHALL prompt for authentication
2. WHEN a user provides valid credentials THEN the system SHALL store the authentication token securely
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL show personalized dashboard elements
4. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored authentication data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to handle errors gracefully, so that I have a smooth user experience even when issues occur

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN API responses are delayed THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
3. WHEN invalid data is entered THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation feedback
4. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show an offline message
5. WHEN errors are recoverable THEN the system SHALL provide retry options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the interface to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and with assistive technologies

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL be fully functional on mobile and desktop devices
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus management
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
4. WHEN animations are disabled THEN the system SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion
5. WHEN high contrast mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see my analysis history and dashboard metrics, so that I can track my code quality improvements over time

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display their analysis history
2. WHEN new analysis is completed THEN the system SHALL update the user's metrics and trends
3. WHEN viewing dashboard THEN the system SHALL show aggregated statistics and charts
4. WHEN analysis data is available THEN the system SHALL provide export functionality
5. WHEN no history exists THEN the system SHALL show appropriate empty state messages

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a modern, responsive landing page that showcases an AI Code Reviewer application. The landing page will feature a glassmorphism aesthetic with translucent cards, soft shadows, and blurred backdrops. It will use Sora Bold typography for headings and implement smooth GSAP animations including hero entrance effects, card hover interactions, background parallax, and scroll-triggered reveals. The page must be pixel-accurate to the provided design images while maintaining accessibility standards and optimal performance across all devices.

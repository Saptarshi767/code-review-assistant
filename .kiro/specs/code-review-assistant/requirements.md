# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Code Review Assistant is an automated code analysis system that accepts source code files through a backend API, performs LLM-powered analysis for code quality, security, and best practices, and returns structured review reports. The system includes optional report storage and a dashboard interface for managing reviews.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload source code files for automated review, so that I can get immediate feedback on code quality without waiting for human reviewers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a single source code file THEN the system SHALL accept files with extensions .py, .js, .java, .ts, .go, .cpp, .c, .rb, .php
2. WHEN a user uploads a zip file containing multiple source files THEN the system SHALL extract and process all supported source files within the archive
3. WHEN a file exceeds the maximum size limit (10MB) THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating the file is too large
4. WHEN an unsupported file type is uploaded THEN the system SHALL return an error message listing supported file types
5. IF a file contains binary content THEN the system SHALL reject the file and return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive structured code review reports, so that I can understand specific issues and improvements needed in my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL return a JSON report containing summary, issues, and recommendations
2. WHEN issues are identified THEN each issue SHALL include type, severity level (high/medium/low), line number, description, and suggested fix
3. WHEN recommendations are provided THEN they SHALL be categorized by area (readability, modularity, security, performance, style)
4. WHEN multiple files are analyzed THEN the system SHALL aggregate results into a unified report with file-specific sections
5. IF no issues are found THEN the system SHALL return a positive confirmation with general code quality assessment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to detect security vulnerabilities in my code, so that I can address potential security risks before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code contains potential security vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL flag them with high severity
2. WHEN API keys, passwords, or secrets are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately alert and redact them from the report
3. WHEN SQL injection risks are identified THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation suggestions
4. WHEN insecure cryptographic practices are found THEN the system SHALL recommend secure alternatives
5. IF sensitive data patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL warn about data exposure risks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access my previous code review reports, so that I can track improvements over time and reference past recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a review is completed THEN the system SHALL store the report with a unique identifier
2. WHEN a user requests their review history THEN the system SHALL return a list of past reports with metadata
3. WHEN a user requests a specific report THEN the system SHALL return the full report details
4. WHEN reports are stored THEN they SHALL include timestamp, filename, language, and summary
5. IF a user has no previous reports THEN the system SHALL return an empty list with appropriate message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with the system through a REST API, so that I can integrate code review into my development workflow and CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL require valid authentication via API key or JWT token
2. WHEN uploading files THEN the POST /api/review endpoint SHALL accept multipart/form-data
3. WHEN requesting report status THEN the GET /api/review/{report_id} endpoint SHALL return current processing status
4. WHEN listing reports THEN the GET /api/reviews endpoint SHALL support pagination and filtering
5. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 with retry-after header

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use a web dashboard to upload files and view reports, so that I can easily interact with the system without using command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide a file upload interface with drag-and-drop support
2. WHEN viewing reports THEN the dashboard SHALL display structured results with syntax highlighting
3. WHEN browsing report history THEN the dashboard SHALL show a searchable list of past reviews
4. WHEN viewing report details THEN the dashboard SHALL highlight code sections with inline annotations
5. IF processing is in progress THEN the dashboard SHALL show real-time status updates

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to handle large codebases efficiently, so that performance remains acceptable even with complex projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing files larger than token limits THEN the system SHALL chunk code by function/class boundaries
2. WHEN multiple chunks are processed THEN the system SHALL merge results into a unified report
3. WHEN processing takes longer than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL process asynchronously and return a job ID
4. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them in order
5. IF processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before marking as failed

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want assurance that my code is handled securely, so that I can trust the system with proprietary or sensitive code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is sent to external LLMs THEN the system SHALL display privacy warnings and require explicit consent
2. WHEN sensitive patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL offer local LLM processing options
3. WHEN storing reports THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data at rest
4. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS/TLS encryption
5. IF data retention policies apply THEN the system SHALL automatically delete reports after specified periods

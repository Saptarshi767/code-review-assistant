# Gemini API Integration Setup

Your AI Code Reviewer app has been updated to use Google Gemini API directly instead of requiring a backend server.

## What Changed

1. **Direct API Integration**: The app now calls Google Gemini API directly from the frontend
2. **No Backend Required**: You don't need to run a Python backend server anymore
3. **Simplified Authentication**: No login/logout system needed
4. **Faster Analysis**: Direct API calls without server overhead

## Files Modified

- `gemini-client.js` - New Gemini API client
- `app.js` - Updated to use Gemini client instead of backend API
- `index.html` - Updated to load Gemini client
- `.env` - Updated Gemini model to `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`

## How to Use

1. **Open the App**: Simply open `index.html` in your browser
2. **Analyze Code**: 
   - Type or paste code in the editor
   - Click "Run Analysis" button
   - Or upload a code file using the upload area
3. **View Results**: Analysis results will appear immediately

## Testing

- Open `test-gemini.html` to test the Gemini integration
- The test page will validate your API key and allow you to test code analysis

## API Key

Your Gemini API key is configured in:
- `.env` file: `GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBM7Jy7lAdKku6oxxwnRFILAO2T8XLO0rM`
- Hardcoded in `app.js` for direct frontend use

## Supported Features

✅ **Working Features:**
- Code analysis with Gemini AI
- File upload and analysis
- Real-time code editor analysis
- Issue detection and suggestions
- Security and performance analysis
- Accessibility features

- Rate limiting (handled by Gemini API)

## Browser Compatibility

The app works in all modern browsers that support:

## Troubleshooting

1. **API Key Issues**: Check browser console for API key validation errors
2. **CORS Issues**: Gemini API supports CORS, so no issues expected
3. **File Upload Issues**: Check file size (max 10MB) and supported extensions
4. **Analysis Errors**: Check network connection and API key validity

## Next Steps
